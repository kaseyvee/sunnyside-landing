### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Framer Motion - React animation library
- Sass
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To go with the vibrant and fun theme of this project, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to look into some animation libraries. Here, I used Framer Motion to add some visual interactivity as the user scrolls through the page and on opening the nav menu on mobile.

This challenge also helped with starting to get comfortable using pseudo elements such as ```::before``` to add some extra visual spice!
